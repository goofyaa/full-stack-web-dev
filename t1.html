    <h1>MY FIRST POEM....</h1>
    <pre>        warm sun and twinkly nights ,
        a shared peice of jaggery in winter light.

        red stuffy nose or puffy eyes,
        winter still amuses me with its perfect paradise.

        uncanny mist in the concrete jungle ,
        yet we still navigate like its a tunnel.

        jingle bells and merry chimes,
        yeah!!! i wouldnt know because i am an indian child.

        still i see the warmth in this frost,
        and wonder if i am just blind or this sight comes with a cost.
